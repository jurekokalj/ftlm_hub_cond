Finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM) code for optical conductivity of a 2d nearest-neighbor hopping Hubbard model.

If using this code, cite the following FTLM review article:

J. Jaklič and P. Prelovšek, "Finite-temperature properties of doped antiferromagnets", Advances in Physics 49, 2000, pp 1-49.

There the method is described in great detail, together with many obtained results. Also some notation in the code is following this review.

Additionally, the method is described also in 

P. Prelovšek and J. Bonča, Strongly Correlated Systems Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences, Volume 176, 2013, pp 1-30.

and briefly in 

J. Kokalj and R. McKenzie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 206402 (2013). 
 
The method is still under development/improvements and needs to be further optimized and cleaned.
